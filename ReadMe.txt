'ABOUT THE PROGRAM
'When this program is first run, it will make a copy
'of your desktop and put it in the app's path in
'the folder \Original
'However you desktop looked when you first ran the
'program is how the program restores your desktop
'to original from the popupmenu
'If you want to restart the original copy, then
'delete the file "Desktopper.ini"
'and the folder "MyShortcuts" in the app's path
'
'
'
'WARNING!!!!!!!!!!
'YOU REALLY SHOULD BACK UP YOUR DESKTOP ICONS
'BEFORE RUNNING THIS PROGRAM, AS IT DOES A LOT
'OF MANIPULATING OF THE DESKTOP ICONS
'JUST COPY ALL THE FILES FROM C:\Windows\Desktop
'TO A FOLDER OF YOUR CHOICE
'YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.
'
'IF YOU DON'T BACKUP AND YOU LOSE YOUR ICONS, THEN
'I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT!
'
'
'IN THE RARE CASE THAT THIS PROGRAM CRASHES AND
'LEAVES YOUR DESKTOP INCOMPLETE, YOU CAN RESTORE
'IT BY COPYING THE FILES BACK TO C:\Windows\Desktop
'
'ONE MORE THING - WHEN USING THE BUMP BUTTONS
'YOU CAN INCREASE THE BUMP AMOUNT BY HOLDING DOWN
'THE <Ctrl>, <Shift> and/or <Alt> KEYS
